/**
 * Matching a device the user picked in the browser against one Windows can open.
 *
 * The two sides name the same hardware differently — Chromium appends USB ids
 * ("Logitech StreamCam (046d:0893)") while DirectShow, Media Foundation and
 * WASAPI report the driver's friendly name — so the match cannot be equality.
 * It can, however, be *decisive*: every real pairing observed is one name
 * containing the other, and nothing weaker is trusted.
 *
 * There used to be a further tier that scored shared WORDS, meant to bridge
 * names that differ more than that. It bridged names that were not the same
 * device at all. "Logi Capture" and "Logitech StreamCam" share no word, but
 * "logi" is inside "logitech" — enough to win, so choosing a camera Media
 * Foundation cannot see opened a different camera instead of falling through to
 * the provider that would have found the right one. The microphone side reached
 * the same place by the same road, "micro" sitting inside the "microphone" that
 * opens nearly every Windows endpoint name (getdrift/drift#404, #405).
 *
 * Dropping that tier costs nothing measurable: on the reporter's machine every
 * camera and microphone resolves at 800 or above without it. What it buys is
 * that "I could not find it" is now reachable — and a caller that hears it can
 * try another provider, or say so, instead of recording the wrong device.
 *
 * This lives here rather than in `electron/ipc/handlers.ts` because that module
 * calls `app.getPath()` while being imported and cannot be loaded from a test.
 * The C++ helpers carry their own copy of these rules, covered by the
 * Windows-only scripts in `scripts/` that drive the real binary.

 * other exactly, at the highest score there is. The C++ helpers use
 * `std::iswalnum` on wide characters and never had that flaw; this is the copy
