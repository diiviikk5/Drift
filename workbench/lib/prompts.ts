 * The Auto-enhance prompt the wizard scenarios send. It is NOT the string the
 * button sends any more: `src/components/ai-edition/v4/V4Timeline.tsx:77`
 * narrowed to cuts only in `7e6439ad`, because the model places zooms from what
 * the transcript SAYS rather than from where the pointer WAS — on a real 66s
 * screencast, 7 of its 9 focus points missed the cursor in their own window.
 *
 * This copy stays WIDE on purpose. That same commit names `real-wizard-enhance`
 * as the scenario that would show the model can read the track and justify
 * re-widening the product, and no scenario can measure zoom placement under a
 * prompt that never asks for a zoom: `dsl.zoom.placement` (weight 3) opens with
 * `fail("aucun zoom émis")`. The `wizard-enhance` pair scores the D1 fabricated
 * focus and D2 multiplier tells the same way — under the narrow prompt those
 * checks go green without anything having been fixed.
 *
 * So the divergence is deliberate, but it IS a divergence: re-narrowing this
 * string means reworking the zoom checks in all three scenarios and re-recording
 * their baselines, which is why it is not a one-line edit.
 *
 * ponytail: this said "VERBATIM copy … the string the Auto-enhance button sends"
 * from `7e6439ad` until now, pointing at `V4Timeline.tsx:57-58` where the
 * constant no longer lives. Nothing said so — `npm run wb` is not part of CI.

Apply the edits directly to the timeline.";

/**
 * The tools Drift builds in `deep-agent/service.ts` (`buildTools`), and the
 * filesystem/todo/sub-agent tools that must never appear beside them again.
 *
 * Both are RE-EXPORTS, not copies. The bench used to keep its own hand-written
 * pair, and both went stale without anything noticing: the tool roster sat at 19
 * from the day it was written while the agent grew to 21 (`addTrims`/`addZooms`),
 * and the phantom list was missing `execute`, so `isPhantomTool` could not flag
 * the one middleware tool a sandbox backend would have re-introduced. Nothing
 * caught either, because `npm run wb` is not part of CI — the bench was checking
 * the product against a surface the product had outgrown.
 *
 * `agent-tools.ts` is the right home for them: it already owns
 * `MUTATING_TOOL_NAMES` and runs on zod plus pure document helpers, so importing
 * it costs L0 nothing (four L0 files already pull `executeAgentTool` from it).
 * Importing `deep-agent/service.ts` instead would drag LangChain down here.
 *
 * What keeps the roster honest is `deep-agent/service.test.ts`, which asserts it
 * equals `buildTools(...).map(t => t.name)` — and that suite runs in CI. A tool
 * added without updating the roster now fails the build rather than a bench
 * nobody runs.
