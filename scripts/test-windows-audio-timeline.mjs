/**
 * Does a sound land where it happened?
 *
 * The helper's audio timestamps come from a running count of emitted frames, so
 * they only describe the take if a chunk goes out for every chunk of real time.
 * When that count advanced only while a source had samples queued, a recording
 * that began in silence emitted nothing until something played — and the first
 * sound landed at timestamp zero, with the track shorter than the take by the
 * silence it skipped (getdrift/drift#406).
 *
 * A working microphone hid it, streaming continuously and keeping the queue
 * non-empty, which is why it surfaced as a system-audio desync on a machine
 * whose microphone had failed.
 *
 * WASAPI cannot run on Linux CI, so this drives the real helper: record in
 * silence, play a tone at a known instant, and measure where the tone actually
 * sits in the file.
 *
 *   npm run test:wgc-audio-timeline:win
 *
 * Plays through the default render endpoint, so that device has to be working
 * and audible — this measures the machine as much as the code.
