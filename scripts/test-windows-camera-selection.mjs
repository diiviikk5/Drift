/**
 * Which camera does the helper actually open?
 *
 * Media Foundation and DirectShow cannot run on Linux CI and there is no C++
 * test harness here, so the selection rules are checked the only way that proves
 * anything: by driving the real helper on a real Windows machine and reading
 * back what it says it opened.
 *
 * What is pinned is that a requested name either resolves to THAT camera or to
 * none at all. A name matching nothing must score zero, because zero is what
 * sends the request on to the DirectShow fallback — the provider that holds
 * every camera Media Foundation cannot enumerate, NVIDIA Broadcast among them. A
 * near-miss that scores instead opens the wrong camera and the fallback is never
 * reached (getdrift/drift#405).
 *
 *   npm run test:wgc-camera-selection:win
 *
 * The happy path needs a camera that exists here: pass its name through
 * DRIFT_WGC_TEST_WEBCAM_DEVICE_NAME, or that case is skipped.
