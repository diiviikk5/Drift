/**
 * Does a sound land where it happened, and does the track cover the whole take?
 *
 * The macOS sibling of scripts/test-windows-audio-timeline.mjs, and it asks one more
 * question than that one does. The helper's mixed audio track used to take its origin
 * from the first buffer that happened to arrive, so a take beginning in silence began
 * the track wherever the first sound was — and it never called
 * `writer.endSession(atSourceTime:)`, so the file also ENDED at the last sample anything
 * delivered. Leading silence missing at the front, trailing silence missing at the back,
 * one cause: a cursor advanced by data instead of by a clock.
 *
 *   npm run test:sck-audio-timeline:mac
 *
 * Records ten seconds — four silent, three with a tone, three silent again — and measures
 * where the tone sits and how long each track is. Plays through the default output device
 * and captures the default display, so both have to be working: this measures the machine
 * as much as the code. `swift test` is the half that measures only the code, and that one
 * runs on every pull request.
 *
 * Two tolerances, because the two measurements are not equally tight:
 *
 *   - The tone's position is compared against the instant playback was ASKED for, so it
 *     carries afplay's start-up latency and the output device waking up. 250 ms.
 *   - The audio track's length is compared against the VIDEO track's length in the same
 *     file. Both come from one writer session and one endSession, so no wall clock enters
 *     it at all and the comparison can be tight. 100 ms.
 *
 * That second one is the assertion with teeth, and it is the one Windows cannot make: its
 * script has no video track to compare against and settles for "not shorter than the
 * silence", with TOLERANCE_S = 1.0.
