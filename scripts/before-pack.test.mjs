// DRIFT_SYMBOL_FLOOR=host relaxes the one guard that keeps a Linux package
// startable on the distros the README claims. That is the right trade for a developer
// building for their own machine and a shipping bug anywhere else, so the two refusals
// that keep it local — an unknown value, and CI — are tested rather than trusted.
//
// Neither needs a payload to scan: resolveSymbolCeiling() decides from the environment
// alone, which is why it is the seam this file pokes at. The comparison it feeds is
// exercised for real by every `npm run build:linux`.
//
// The mode is read once at module load, so each case re-requires before-pack.cjs with a
// different environment instead of mutating state on an already-loaded copy.
