/**
 * Which microphone does the helper actually open?
 *
 * WASAPI cannot run on Linux CI and there is no C++ test harness here, so the
 * selection rules are checked the only way that proves anything: by driving the
 * real helper on a real Windows machine and reading what it says it chose.
 *
 * What is being pinned is the pair of promises the recording flow rests on —
 * the microphone the user asked for is the one recorded, and when it cannot be
 * found the helper SAYS SO instead of quietly capturing something else
 * (getdrift/drift#404). The second half needs the first: a fuzzy name
 * match that resolved "some microphone" made the warning unreachable, because a
 * device had after all been resolved.
 *
 *   npm run test:wgc-mic-selection:win
 *
 * Case 4 needs a real microphone name; pass one that exists on this machine
 * through DRIFT_WGC_TEST_MICROPHONE_DEVICE_NAME, or it is skipped.
