/**
 * Does a sound land where it happened, and does the track cover the whole take?
 *
 * The Linux sibling of scripts/test-macos-audio-timeline.mjs, asking the same questions
 * of a helper that answers them for a different reason. Windows and macOS both had to
 * move their audio timeline onto a clock (getdrift/drift#406, and the macOS
 * anchor after it). Linux never did, and the code is not why: `AudioEncoder::next_pts`
 * is a running count of the samples handed to the encoder — the same data-driven cursor
 * Windows had — and `AudioMix::pump` returns early when no input has any. What holds the
 * timeline up is the TAP. System audio here is the default sink's monitor, and PipeWire
 * keeps delivering its buffers whether or not anything is playing, silence included,
 * where the WASAPI loopback tap simply stops. So the count advances at real time and the
 * cursor cannot stall.
 *
 * That is exactly why this is worth running: the property belongs to the capture source,
 * not to the helper, and nothing in the helper would notice the day the source changed.
 * The whole record that any of it held was one sentence in a commit message — a live
 * 29-second capture, an 18-second tone coming back as 18 seconds of steady signal, the
 * two streams ending 62 ms apart. This is that sentence, re-runnable.
 *
 *   npm run test:pw-audio-timeline:linux
 *
 * Records ten seconds — four silent, three with a tone, three silent again — and measures
 * where the tone sits and how long each track is. NOT unattended: the portal raises the
 * compositor's own source picker and the take does not begin until someone answers it.
 * The tone plays to the DEFAULT SINK, which has to be the sink whose monitor the helper
 * captured, so this measures the machine as much as the code.
 *
 * Two tolerances, because the two measurements are not equally tight:
 *
 *   - The tone's position is compared against the instant playback was ASKED for, so it
 *     carries the player's start-up latency and the node it creates being linked into the
 *     graph. 250 ms.
 *   - The audio track's length is compared against the VIDEO track's length in the same
 *     file — no wall clock enters that at all. 250 ms rather than the 100 ms macOS uses,
 *     because there the two tracks come out of one writer session and here they do not:
 *     the video track ends at the last `Capture::advance()` and the audio track at
 *     everything the rings still held, plus AAC's final padded block. Those measured
 *     62 ms apart on a 29-second capture (video 29.100 s, audio 29.162 s), which is the
 *     number this bound is set around. It is still far tighter than the failure it is
 *     here for, which is a track that ends at the last sound and misses three seconds.
